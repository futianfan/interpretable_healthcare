INTERPRETABLE DEEP LEARNING FOR HEALTHCARE



For rule list part, we directly use the code from:
https://github.com/nlarusstone/corels

For word2vec, we use the code (https://github.com/Adoni/word2vec_pytorch)

src/neural_net-v1.py:  first version rule-list + lstm + prototype + binary classify
src/neural_net-v2.py:  second version rule + bi-lstm + prototype + binary classify
src/neural_net-v3.py:  bi-lstm + full-connect + binary classify 

v4: final state => hidden state
v5: full-connect => conv1d

./run.sh
